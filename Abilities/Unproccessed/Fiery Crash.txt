Ability: Fiery Crash Static Effect: Whenever the user uses a Move with the Dash keyword, they may either increase that Moveâ€™s Damage Base by +2, or change the Move to be Fire-Type if it was not already. All Moves with the Dash keyword performed as Fire-Typed burn their target on 19+, or increase the effect range by +2 if they could already inflict Burn.
