Ability: Quick Cloak At-Will – Standard Action Effect: Burmy quickly builds a cloak out of nearby materials; using leaves and twigs will give it a Grass Plant Cloak, using sand and rocks will give it a Ground Sandy Cloak, and using trash or scrap will give it a Steel Trash Cloak. While in a Cloak, Burmy gains the Type associated with the Cloak as a secondary Typing, which will become permanent upon evolution into Wormadam. Cloaks are destroyed if Burmy is hit for Super-Effective Damage, or if Burmy makes a new Cloak.
