Ability: Harvest At-Will – Free Action Effect: Whenever the user trades in a Digestion Buff from a Berry, flip a coin. On heads, the user gains all the benefits of the Digestion Buff, but the Buff is not used up. On tails, the Buff is consumed normally. While in Sunny Weather, the Buff is never consumed. The user may trade in a Digestion Buff up to once per turn during an encounter, but only until they flip “Tails”.
