Ability: Anchored Static Effect: Dhelmise has an Anchor token on the field, which occupies one square as if it is Medium sized but is otherwise ignored for cover and targeting. Dhelmise cannot move or be moved more than 3 meters away from its Anchor, willingly or otherwise. The Anchor token itself cannot be pushed, pulled, or moved against Dhelmise's will in any way. Dhelmise may shift their Anchor Token as a Swift Action, moving it to any open space within 3 meters of itself. Bonus: When the user Shifts the Anchor, it may immediately afterwards originate a damaging attack from its Anchor if it has the appropriate action available, giving that attack the following properties: the attack's range changes to "Melee, 1 Target", the attack deals +2d6 damage, and the attack's Class changes to Physical if it wasn't already.
