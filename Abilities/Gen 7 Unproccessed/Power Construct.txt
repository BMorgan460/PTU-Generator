Ability: Power Construct Daily - Swift Action Special: The user can only use Power Construct while below 50% HP Effect: The user changes to Complete Forme until the end of the Scene, and gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half of the maximum hit points that Complete Forme would have. The user cannot gain Temporary Hit Points from other sources while in Complete Forme. Special: The user still uses the HP total and HP Maximum of the Forme that it was in (10% or 50% Forme) before entering Complete Forme. Both Formes must still follow BSR.
